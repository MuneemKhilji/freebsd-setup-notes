first install freebsd and put the users that should use the su command
in wheel or else they wont be able to use the su command.

then run freebsd when ur done with the installation of freebsd

then install the drm-kmod

the first thing to do is to find out all the configuration u would need to do for some basic gui. in my case i tried the official handbook and it didnt help.
then i ran startx and followed the log files it gave me and that was it.

then enable dbus by writing sysrc dbus_enable="YES" in the commandline

then mount procfs by default by in the file: "/etc/fstab" the line below:
proc         /proc   procfs  rw    0 0  

now in case u wonna use xorg and xfce then install sddm and write:
sysrc sddm_enable="YES"
//commands for installing xfce
in the commandline



 these are the steps that worked for me and i wrote these notes for my own
self so if there are any errors then i dont care cuz i am new to freebsd
and i just didnt wanted to lose the steps that worked for me.








also note that the  ufs file system dosent automactically take up snapshots of all ur files.
